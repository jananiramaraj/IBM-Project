HealthAI is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist patients with their health-related queries. It provides 24/7 support and delivers personalized responses by using patient details such as name, age, gender, medical history, current medications, and allergies. The chatbot leverages advanced language models from Hugging Faceâ€™s `ibm-granite/granite-3.2-2b-instruct` to generate human-like, context-aware advice in a conversational manner.
